    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I was born and raised in Houston, Texas as the youngest of four children. After high school, I moved up to Dallas to attend SMU. During my time there, I pursued an undergraduate degree in Sports Management with a Spanish minor. I was even able to live in Madrid, Spain for over a month.

      After graduating, I started an internship at the Topgolf corporate headquarters in Dallas, Texas. Since joining, I have held three different positions, and have learned a ton about the business. Through some of the work I do there, I have become familiar with web development. My interest has grown significantly, which brings me here!
